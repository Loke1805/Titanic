🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project performed on a 1000-row Titanic dataset.
This project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualizations, insights, and summary findings using Python.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project:-
➡️ titanic_1000.csv
(Generated with 1000 synthetic passenger records for learning & practice)

🎯 Project Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to:
*Understand dataset structure.
*Clean missing, incorrect, or inconsistent data.
*Identify patterns and trends.
*Visualize relationships between features.
*Extract insights useful for modeling.
